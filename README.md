# Beethoven-Piano-Sonatas

BPS MIDI Datasetï¼šBeethoven Piano Sonatas MIDI Dataset. It contains 242 60-second music samples extracted from Beethoven Piano Sonatas.

We first garnered a complete set of Beethoven piano sonatas from the Internet. Out of each movement of each sonata, several segments of 60 seconds in length were extracted by truncating from the beginning of each movement with 2 minutes in intervals, which consisted of a total of 242 60-second music samples. These samples constitute our BPS MIDI dataset.
